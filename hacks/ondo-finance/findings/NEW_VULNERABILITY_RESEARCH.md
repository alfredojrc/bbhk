# 🔍 NEW VULNERABILITY RESEARCH - ONDO FINANCE

## ⚠️ Critical Update: Pivot Strategy Required

### What We've Learned:
1. **Finding #1 (USDC Depeg)**: ❌ Already reported in March 2024 Code4rena audit and FIXED
2. **Finding #2 (Reentrancy)**: ⚠️ Uncertain - needs evidence of actual KYC callbacks  
3. **Finding #3 (Oracle Desync)**: ✅ Has potential - similar attacks succeeded in 2025

### Real RWA Exploits in 2025 (Evidence of Viability):
- **Loopscale**: $5.8M loss via oracle manipulation (April 2025)
- **Zoth**: $8.5M loss via compromised key + logic flaw (March 2025)
- **Total RWA exploits H1 2025**: $14.6M (146% increase from 2024)

## 🎯 NEW ATTACK VECTORS TO EXPLORE

### 1. Chainlink Oracle Integration Vulnerabilities
**Hypothesis**: The fix for USDC depeg may have introduced new vulnerabilities
- Check if Chainlink oracle can be frontrun
- Test heartbeat delay exploitation
- Verify deviation threshold attacks
- Look for gas griefing on oracle updates

### 2. Multi-Token Arbitrage (OUSG ↔ USDY ↔ BUIDL)
**Hypothesis**: Three different yield tokens create arbitrage opportunities
- OUSG: Increasing NAV model
- USDY: Rebasing token model  
- BUIDL: Monthly airdrop model
- Different settlement times = arbitrage windows

### 3. MEV/Sandwich Attacks on Instant Redemptions
**Evidence**: Research shows MEV bots actively targeting USDY transactions
- High-frequency sandwich attacks observed
- Flash loan arbitrage confirmed
- Cross-chain timing differences exploitable

### 4. KYC Whitelist Bypass via Contract Factories
**Hypothesis**: Factory pattern might bypass KYC checks
- Deploy minimal proxy contracts
- Use CREATE2 for deterministic addresses
- Exploit timing between whitelist and execution

### 5. Redemption Limit Edge Cases
**Known Issue**: Code4rena found BUIDL redemption limit issues
- Test cascading failures during high redemption
- Exploit minimum balance requirements
- Force contract into locked state

### 6. Cross-Chain Bridge Vulnerabilities
**Hypothesis**: Multi-chain deployment creates bridge risks
- Ethereum ↔ Solana ↔ Polygon timing differences
- Double-spend during bridge delays
- Oracle desync across chains

### 7. Compound V2 Fork Inherited Bugs
**Background**: Flux Finance is a Compound V2 fork
- Check for known Compound vulnerabilities
- Test interest rate model manipulation
- Look for liquidation edge cases

### 8. Operational Security Failures
**Evidence**: Zoth lost $8.5M to compromised key
- Social engineering for admin access
- Timing attacks on multi-sig operations
- Governance proposal manipulation

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

   - Measure deviation thresholds

2. **Factory Pattern KYC Bypass**
   - Deploy proxy factory contract
   - Test whitelist validation timing
   - Attempt unauthorized minting

### Phase 3: Advanced Attacks (5-7 days)
1. **Redemption Cascade Attack**
   - Simulate bank run scenario
   - Exploit minimum balance locks
   - Force protocol into emergency state

2. **Governance Manipulation**
   - Analyze voting mechanisms
   - Test flash loan governance attacks
   - Exploit timelock delays

## 📊 EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

For each vulnerability, we need:
1. **Transaction hashes** showing the exploit
2. **Block numbers** where vulnerability exists
3. **Profit calculations** demonstrating impact
