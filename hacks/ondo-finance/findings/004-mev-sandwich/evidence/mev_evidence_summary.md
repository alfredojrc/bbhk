# 🔍 MEV EVIDENCE SUMMARY - USDY/OUSG

## Status: ⚠️ THEORETICAL EVIDENCE ONLY

### What We Found:

1. **General MEV Statistics (Confirmed)**
   - $1.45M profit from sandwich attacks in last 30 days on Ethereum

### What We DON'T Have:

❌ **Specific MEV transactions on USDY/OUSG**
❌ **Transaction hashes showing sandwich attacks**
❌ **Proof that USDY/OUSG are actually being targeted**
❌ **Evidence of price impact from real attacks**
❌ **Victim addresses or loss amounts**

### Why This Matters:

The vulnerability is **THEORETICALLY SOUND** but lacks **CONCRETE EVIDENCE** of exploitation. Without specific transaction data, this is a "potential vulnerability" rather than a "proven exploit."

### Required Evidence for Strong Submission:

1. **Transaction Hash**: Specific sandwich attack on USDY/OUSG
2. **Victim Address**: User who lost money
3. **MEV Bot Address**: Attacker who profited
4. **Block Numbers**: When attack occurred
5. **Profit Amount**: How much was extracted

### Next Steps to Get Evidence:
1. **Query Dune directly** for USDY/OUSG MEV activity
2. **Search Etherscan** for large USDY/OUSG transactions
3. **Check Flashbots** for private mempool activity
4. **Monitor real-time** for future MEV opportunities

**Verdict**: Valid attack vector but insufficient evidence for high-confidence submission
